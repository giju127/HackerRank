# Arithmetic Operators

**Task**

The provided code stub reads two integers from STDIN, a and b. Add code to print three lines where:
1. The first line contains the sum of the two numbers.
2. The second line contains the difference of the two numbers (first - second).
3. The third line contains the product of the two numbers.

**Example**

a = 3

b = 5

Print the following:
```
8
-2
15
```

**Input Format**

The first line contains the first integer, a.

The second line contains the second integer, b.


**Constraints**

![1 \leq a \leq 10^{10}](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?1%20%5Cleq%20a%20%5Cleq%2010%5E%7B10%7D)

![1 \leq a \leq 10^{10}](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?1%20%5Cleq%20b%20%5Cleq%2010%5E%7B10%7D)

**Output Format**

Print the three lines as explained above.

**Sample Input 0**
```
3
2
```

**Sample Output 0**
```
5
1
6
```

**Explanation 0**

3 + 2 = 5

3 - 2 = 1

3 * 2 = 6
