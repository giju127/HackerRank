# Python If-Else

**Task**

Given an integer, n, perform the following conditional actions:

* If n is odd, print `Weird`
* If n is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5, print `Not Weired`
* If n is even and in the inclusive range 6 to 20, print `Weired`
* If n is even and greater than 20, print `Not Weired`

**Input Format**

A single line containing a positive integer, n.

**Constraints**

* 1 &leq; n &leq; 100

**Output Format**

Print `Weird` if the number is weird. Otherwise, print `Not Weird`.

**Sample Input 0**
```
3
```

**Sample Output 0**
```
Weired
```

**Explanation 0**

n = 3

n is odd and odd numbers are weird, so print `Weird`.

**Sample Input 1**
```
24
```

**Sample Outout 1**
```
Not Weird
```

**Explanation 1**

n = 24

n &gt; 20 and n is even, so it is not weird.
